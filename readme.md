### A save file with every single evolution for every single copy ability is absolutely mandatory for this Manual.

**Locations:**
- Flash Fishing: fishing up different fishes (or performing different actions), each as individual checks
- Defeating enemies: find and defeat enemies inside of levels
- Defeating every variant of King Dedede and Fleurina
- Completing sea-based missions in levels


**Items:**
- Tin of fish: filler item
- Button Presses: allows you to press more buttons during the fishing minigame
- Copy Abilities: allows you to use the respective copy abilities (and all of its evolutions)
- Mouthful Modes: allows you to use the respective mouthful modes


**Win condition:**
- Fish up the largest Blipper, the Bling Blipper; you require 7 Button Presses for this

The latest version has a total of 124 locations (minus the victory condition and one location with a pre-placed item). You start with Everbay Coast Access.

Note: it is out of logic to complete the location "Flash Fishing - Get dragged into the pond" before having three Button Presses, so it's best to fail Flash Fishing about 5 times before starting this game in an Archipelago game.

This was made for the Fish Manual Event Async in the Archipelago Discord server. To find more information about Archipelago: https://archipelago.gg/
